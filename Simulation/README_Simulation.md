Physical Simulation

VC++ 2015

Input: No command line arguments necessary. Various console inputs and key presses while in the GUI which change parameters (see output of the program). Similar camera controls. Space to reset rotation.

Warning: Clicking on the console and GUI sometimes makes the GUI black until the program is ended. I'd recommend only clicking on the title bar to select the GUI and not rotating much.

currently no collision detection. Metastable states are possible. Simulations implemented: A Simple System (kind of throwaway), a Pendulum-Spring System, and a Cloth System
