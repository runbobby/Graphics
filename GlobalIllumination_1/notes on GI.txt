note: importance sampling of reflected rays should be some portion diffuse, some portion Phong (related to diffuse/specular color ratios)


Other things I want to try:

Photon mapping, esp. with different colors

physical simulation of cloth on obstacle

use bcoefficient, ccoefficient for refraction indices

I should probably improve my 3dtree

hacks I should change back:

Make material have specular randomness


check that randomspeculardirection is correct

use the spectrum for distribution of emitted photons' wavelengths
